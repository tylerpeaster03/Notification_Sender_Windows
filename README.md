# Notification_Sender_Windows

Notification_Sender_Windows is a simple UWP XAML/C# application that allows a user to schedule a notification with a title and/or entry. A notification can be scheduled and will display even if the app is not open.
This app was made primarily because I plan on making a Birthday_Scheduler program, but I wanted to gain some experience in how to send notifications in Windows as a feature of that app, so I made this from scratch.
